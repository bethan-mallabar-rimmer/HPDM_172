This is an example file! Here is some random text pasted from the workshop.  One day I'll add a more creative example than this!

n the linux_ws directory, make an empty file called “rags” (touch) 

touch rags 

Create another two called “earth” and “heaven” 

touch heaven earth  

Now list (ls) the contents of the present working directory 

ls 

 

The folder structure should now be like this: 

 

Now list ALL files in the directory 



sadasdsdfjkdjhjksdjkhfjkhsdkjhsdhjkfkjsdhfjksdhfg
sdfsdfdfgdfg
dsjkhdfgjkhfg

Thank you for reading my nonsense file :)
